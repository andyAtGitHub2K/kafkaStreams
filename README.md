# kafkaStreams
This project is an upgrade of examples to Kafka 2.3.0 from Kafka 1.0.

The original sample codes are came from Kafka Streams in Action by William P. Bejeck Jr. published 2018. Because the codes were written under an rather outdated kafka streams 1.0.0, this project is an attempt io bring them up to Kafka Streams 2.3.0.
